Note:

1 . ITDB02 default use the 8bit mode , and if you need the 16 bit mode, you can tear the LCD screen down form the board , and move the R2 resistor to R1 to change the data mode. It's a hard job , and easy to destroy the screen, so if you need a 16bit mode , you had better tell us before shipping , we will set the data mode for you.

2. The I/O of the ITDB02 is 3.3v voltage , so you had better not to directly connect it to the 5v voltage I/O .We suggest using the 30K and 20K resistor to reduce voltage.

3. If you use the 8bit mode , the DB8-DB15 is uesd, please remember to pull the DB0-DB7 to GND.
